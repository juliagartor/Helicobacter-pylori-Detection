# Helicobacter pylori Detection
## Introduction
The aim of this project is to generate an algorithm capalble to detect Helicobacter pyori (a bacteria that is located in the stomach) in biopsy images. To do so, our approach involves the creation of 

## Repository Structure

The project is organized into multiple folders:

- **Obtaining the windows:** Here, we can find the code used to obtain the patches used to train and test the autoencoder. In addition, there is a file with examples of the images obtained.
- **Autoencoder:** This file contains the code used to obtain the autoencoder (Dataloader creation, Grid Search for Parameter Optimization,
- **Eavaluation:**
- **Presentation:** This file contains the presentation of the project.
